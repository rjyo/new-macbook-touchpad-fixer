# NEW MACKBOOK TOUCHPAD FIXER

The touchpad on my new Macbook is way too big to be useful. For example, Chome and Sketch will randomly be zoomed in/out just because my left thumb inattentionally rested on the touchpad.

When I googled, I found that I'm not alone.

> The trackpad is too big. This sounds odd, but itâ€™s unnecessarily large. The size leads occasional palm rejection issues, which means the mouse occasionally jumps around and even accidental clicks from my palm occasionally occur.

Here's how I fixed it

## HOWTO

1. [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rjyo/new-macbook-touchpad-fixer/master/new-macbook-touchpad-fixer.pdf) the PDF and print it on an A4 paper.

2. Use the paper to cut out whatever you like to use to cover the touchpad. I used a tape post-it which is 2.5cm wide.

## WRAP UP

The touchpad can still sensor my touch even with the post-it on. But it seems the input signal is kind of weakened so even with my left thumb on, I can still do normal moving and scrolling without triggering the zoom.
