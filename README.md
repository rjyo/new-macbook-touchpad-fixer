# NEW MACKBOOK TOUCHPAD FIXER

The touchpad on my new Macbook is way too big to be useful. For example, Chome and Sketch will randomly be zoomed in just because my left thumb inattentionally rested on the touchpad.

When I googled, I found that I'm not alone.

> The trackpad is too big. This sounds odd, but it’s unnecessarily large. The size leads occasional palm rejection issues, which means the mouse occasionally jumps around and even accidental clicks from my palm occasionally occur.

Here's how I fixed it

## HOWTO

1. [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rjyo/new-macbook-touchpad-fixer/master/new-macbook-touchpad-fixer.pdf) the PDF and print it on an A4 paper.

2. Use the paper to cut out whatever you like to use to cover the touchpad. I used a tape post-it which is 2.5cm wide.

## WRAP UP

The touchpad can still sensor my touch even with the post-it on. But it seems the input signal is kind of weakened so even with my left thumb on, I can still do normal moving the scrolling without triggering the zoom.
